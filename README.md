RPNES-configs
=============

Configuration files for RetroPie software, for the hardware in the RPNES-1 console.

The files in this repo belong on the SD card of the Raspberry Pi after a RetroPie installation.

RetroPie can be found here: http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/  (project page and SD card image)

RetroPie's github repo and installation script live at https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup.

The root of this repo is a mirror of the root of the SD card, so you can just `mv -rv ~/RPNES-configs/* /media/RPI-SD-CARD/` to install.

The default version of each file is for 4 RetroLink SNES-style USB controllers.  Alternate files have extra extensions for -xbox and -ps3, etc.
